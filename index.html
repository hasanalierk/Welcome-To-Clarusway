        <p class="par-fullstack">
          The Full Stack Web Development program we offer can lead any beginner
          through the process, or take intermediate to advanced-level
          professionals to the next level in their careers! The learning path
          starts with IT Framework for beginners and continues with Front-end
          and Back-end developer course modules. A full-stack web developer is a
          programmer who has the basic knowledge for all layers of an
          application. Each layer is called a “stack”. Full stack web developers
          have the ability to design complete web applications and websites
          which requires both front-end and back-end skills. They work on the
          database and debugging of web applications or websites. Are you ready
          to give your career a boost?
